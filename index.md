## Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a career electronics technician making a transition to a career in software engineering.  I'm currently wrapping up a BS in Computer Science, concentration in Software Engineering.  This page is a digital portfolio of some of the coursework I've completed during the program and am improving for my program capstone.  
Please pardon my dust as I build up this work-in-progress!

### Software Design and Engineering

In CS410: **Software Reverse Engineering**, I reverse-engineered a legacy program from binary to assembly to C++, and corrected security flaws in the source code of the reversed program.  Many of these vulnerabilities were due to the legacy programmer not observing proper considerations of C programming, but the original as well as the reversed and revised programs also lack portability.  Both could be enhanced by porting the reversed application to Java, which imposes stricter compile limitations and is also write-once-run-anywhere.  This work is the result of that translation from C++ to Java, which has been further modified to produce more modular code.  

Further enhancements will include JUnit testing.  Source for this project is available [here](https://github.com/JimmyBoomBots3000/Banking).
