## I'm James

I spent 16 years as an electronics technician before becoming a software engineer. 
You'd be surprised how much overlap there is of the soft skills.
Whether building them up, or tearing them down, circuits and software require a similar type of thinking to mentally digest.

### Professional

I've primarily been a Java developer, but my academic and professional experience has had my working in a variety of languages.
Unfortunately,  100% of what I've worked on professionally so far is proprietary, so I can't share any of it here.
If you're interested in my professional experience, I have [a resume here](https://profile.indeed.com/p/jamesr-zb1cet6).

I'm working on some passion/demo projects that aren't quite ready to share yet, but I'll get them on here as soon as they're ready.

### Academic Portfolio

I put [this portfolio](/academic.md) together when I was still earning my Bachelor's.
Nothing too exciting, but you can see what I was up to when I was pretty new to this.
